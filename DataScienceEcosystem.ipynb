# Data Science Tools and Ecosystem

## __Author:__ 
Matt Menefee

In this notebook, Data Science Tools and Ecosystem are summarized

__Objectives__
- Listing the languages and common tools of a data scientist
- Practice Jupyter notebook formatting skills
- Practice making a Markdown Table
- Upload and share to github
- Practice Ordered/ Unordered Lists

Some of the popular languages that Data Scientists use are:
1. python
2. R
3. Julia
4. Scala
5. SQL
6. Java
7. Swift

lang_list = ["python","R","Julia","Scala","SQL","Java","Swift"]

Some of the commonly used libraries used by Data Scientists include:
1. Pandas
2. Numpy
3. Matplotlib
4. Scikit-learn
5. Keras
6. Tensorflow
7. Pytorch

lib_list = ["pandas","numpy","matplotlib","scikit-learn","keras","tensorflow","pytorch"]

import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
dat = pd.DataFrame(np.column_stack([lang_list,lib_list]), columns=['Data_Science_languages','Data_Science_Libraries'])

### Below are a few examples of evaluating arithmetic expressions in python.

x = (3*4)+5
# This is a simple Arithmetic expression to multiple then add integers
print(x)

# This will convert 200 minutes to hours by diving by 60
t = 200/60 # if we want the expression to round we can use // instead
print(t)

t2 = 200//60
print(t2)
